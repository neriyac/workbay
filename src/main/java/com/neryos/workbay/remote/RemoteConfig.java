/**
 * The one switch a server host has over this mod's mixins, read from a plain file.
 *
 * <p>It cannot be a {@code ModConfigSpec}: configs load long after class transformation, so by the
 * time one could be read the injections have already been applied. Read here instead, by
 * {@link com.neryos.workbay.mixin.RemoteScreenGate} before Mixin asks whether to apply anything, so
 * <b>off means the vanilla classes are never patched at all</b> rather than patched with a handler
 * that returns early. That is the difference between a host being able to say "this mod does not
 * touch {@code Level}" and having to take our word for it.
 *
 * <p>Read twice, once from the mixin plugin and once from mod code, because the two may not share a
 * class loader and a shared static would then be quietly wrong in one of them. Reading a four-line
 * file twice at startup costs nothing worth protecting.
