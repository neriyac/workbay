/**
 * What one link is allowed to carry. SPEC.md §5.
 *
 * <p><b>An entry is a resource, or a tag of them.</b> Not components, not the mod it came from,
 * not a count. Every one of those is a second axis with its own toggle, its own tooltip and its own
 * way of being subtly wrong, and none of them is what a player means by "only iron goes here". XNet
 * ships four such toggles and LaserIO five filter <em>items</em>, and both are answering a routing
 * puzzle this mod deliberately is not (SPEC.md §0).
 *
 * <p><b>Tags are the one that was actually asked for</b>, and were out until it became clear what
 * they cost: "all ores into this chest" was nine rows a player had to list by hand and get wrong,
 * and every mod in the genre — XNet, EnderIO, LaserIO — ships a tag mode. OPEN_ISSUES #33.
 *
 * <p><b>An entry keeps its item even when it matches by tag.</b> That is the whole trick: the slot
 * still has a sprite to draw and a name to cycle through, so a tag entry is the item the player
 * dropped in with a different question attached, rather than a fifth kind of thing the panel has to
 * be able to show. It is also what makes stepping through an item's tags reversible — the item is
 * still there to step back to.
 *
 * <p><b>Whitelist and blacklist, one flag.</b> "Everything except cobblestone" is the same question
 * asked the other way round and it costs one boolean and one {@code !=}; a mod that answers only
 * the first half sends the player back to a chest full of cobblestone with nothing to do about it.
 *
 * <p>An <b>empty list means no filter at all</b>, in both modes. A deny list with nothing on it
 * denies nothing, which is the only reading that does not make a half-configured filter stop a
 * link dead.
 *
 * <p>The ids are ids, and which registry they name is the <em>link's</em> business: an item link's
 * are items, a fluid link's are fluids, a chemical link's are chemicals. That is why changing a
 * link's resource clears its filter ({@link BusConfig#withResource}) — the same nine ids read as
 * nonsense in the other registry, and silently keeping them is how a link starts refusing
 * everything for no visible reason. Energy has no identity to match on and therefore no filter.
