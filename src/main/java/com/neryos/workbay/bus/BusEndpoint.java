 * {@link BlockCapabilityCache}, which also gives the right answer for free when the target is not
 * loaded: null, without dragging the chunk back in.
 *
 * <p><b>Never pass a null side.</b> Mekanism hands out a read-only handler for null, so a bus
 * written against "internal access" semantics finds a handler, moves nothing, and reports no error.
 * {@link #resolve} therefore tries the six real faces and keeps the first that accepts.
