/**
 * One link: one bay, one Connector, one resource. SPEC.md §0, §4 and §9.
 *
 * <p><b>"Link" is the word the player reads and "bus" is the word the code uses.</b> They are the
 * same thing; the screen calls the list LINKS because every row is anchored by a Connector block
 * the player put there.
 *
 * <p>A link exists because a {@link com.neryos.workbay.content.connector.ConnectorBlock} exists in
 * the world. There is no way to type a position into a screen, which is why {@link #connector} and
 * {@link #target} are both plain fields rather than optionals: a link with neither is not a link.
 * The target is derived once, when the Connector is placed, so the runner never has to read the
 * Connector's blockstate from a tick.
 *
 * <p>A link targets exactly one position. No priority, no round-robin, no distance tiebreak — those
 * only mean anything with several targets, and Connectors are cheap enough that three destinations
 * are three Connectors. That deletes three widgets, a persisted rotation index, and everything they
 * would need synced, saved and tested.
 *
 * <p>Immutable, so a config can be handed around and compared with {@code equals} for the
 * server-side polling that {@code broadcastChanges} does.
