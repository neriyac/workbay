/**
 * The eight status pips on the front of a Workbay. One per link, in the LINKS list's own order.
 *
 * <p>SPEC.md §7 gives the block one job — answer "is something wrong?" from across the room —
 * and the frame's own lit state already does it for the bay as a whole. These say <i>which</i>
 * link, which is the question a player asks second and which no single-colour block can answer:
 * eight independent lamps is 65,536 combinations, so it cannot be a blockstate and has to be
 * drawn.
 *
 * <p>The texture draws eight <b>grey sockets</b> and this lights the ones with a link in them, so
 * a Workbay with no links, an unloaded chunk, or a client that failed to get the update tag all
 * degrade to the same honest picture rather than to a hole. Only OK / ATTENTION / BROKEN are
 * drawn; {@code NONE} is the socket already in the texture.
