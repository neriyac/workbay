/**
 * The real block, turned by dragging it. SPEC.md §4's face config and upgrades preview.
 *
 * <p>SPEC.md §4 asked for "an isometric cube". A drawn cube is a picture of <em>a</em> block, not of
 * <b>this</b> block, and a player configuring an Enrichment Chamber's faces needs to see an
 * Enrichment Chamber. So this renders the actual block model through the game's own block renderer,
 * at whatever angle the player has dragged it to.
 *
 * <p>The face roles ride as markers at each visible face's projected centre rather than as coloured
 * quads laid over the model. Painting over the block would hide the thing the player came here to
 * look at, and depth-fighting a rotating model in a GUI layer is a fight with no prize.
