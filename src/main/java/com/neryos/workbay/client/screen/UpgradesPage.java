 * Screen 3 — Upgrades. SPEC.md §4 and §1.
 *
 * <p>Upgrades are <b>consumed on install</b> and recorded as counters, so there is no slot grid and
 * no removal path: an Add button takes the item out of the player's inventory and the count goes up
 * by one, for good. Rows the player cannot afford draw at 45% rather than disappearing, because the
 * ladder is the progression and hiding its rungs hides the game.
 *
 * <p>Taller than SPEC.md §4's 206: three upgrade rows at 34px plus the header
 * do not fit in 206 without the rows losing their one-line description, which is the only thing on
 * the row that says what the upgrade does.
