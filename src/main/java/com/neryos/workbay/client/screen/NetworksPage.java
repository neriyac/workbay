/**
 * Screen 5 — Networks. SPEC.md §0's network model.
 *
 * <p><b>One Workbay block is one network</b>, and this is the page that says which. It is the only
 * page a Workbay holding <em>no</em> network has: placing one while every network you own already
 * has a block is never refused, so the block stands there empty and opens here, on the list, with a
 * Transfer beside each row. It is also reachable from a working Workbay, because "which network is
 * this block" is a question with an answer that can be changed.
 *
 * <p>A row is a network: its name, where its block stands, and what is in it. <b>Never its code</b>
 * — SPEC.md §0 mints one so a lost network can be recovered by typing it to an operator and shows
 * it nowhere else. A network with no block reads <em>Asleep</em>, which is the whole of what that
 * state is: everything kept, nothing ticking.
