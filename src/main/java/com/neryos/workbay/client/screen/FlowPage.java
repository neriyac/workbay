 * <p><b>A canvas, not three columns.</b> Three fixed columns can draw one hop and no more: a chest
 * feeding a bay that feeds another bay that fills a barrel is four steps, and in three columns the
 * middle one has to be two of them at once. So the boxes are free objects relaxed into place, the
 * panel grows to whatever the flow needs, and a link that goes back the way it came is drawn
 * going back.
 *
 * <p>A <b>dashed blue</b> edge never leaves the Workbay; a solid one crosses the world boundary,
 * and stalled draws amber. Bay nodes carry the machine's own item, because an eighty-pixel node
 * cannot hold "Metallurgic Infuser" and the sprite is what a player recognises first.
