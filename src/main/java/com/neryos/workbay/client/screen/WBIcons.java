     * <p><b>A palette is what made three of these icons possible at all.</b> Items is a bar, a gem
     * and a pinch of dust; in one tint those are a smudge, and in three colours they are three
     * things. The redstone torch is the same story — a blob on a stick is a trophy until the blob
     * is red.
     *
     * <p>A palette colour is still <b>scaled by how bright the tint is</b>, so a coloured icon
     * dims exactly where a monochrome one does: a control drawn with {@link Draw#TEXT_FAINT}
     * must not be the one thing on a disabled row that stays at full strength.
