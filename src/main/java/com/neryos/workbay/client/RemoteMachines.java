/**
 * The client's copy of a machine it was never sent, for as long as its screen is open.
 *
 * <p>A whole chunk rather than a block entity, because that is the question mods actually ask —
 * see {@link com.neryos.workbay.mixin.ClientChunkCacheMixin}. It holds exactly one block: the
 * machine's state, so {@code getBlockState} is right, and its block entity, so {@code
 * getBlockEntity} is right. Everything else in it is air, and nothing renders it.
 *
 * <p><b>And the machine on its own, at its own position.</b> A whole chunk can only be handed over
 * where vanilla had no chunk to give, and the first network anybody makes lives in chunk (0, 0) —
 * which a player building near the world origin has loaded in their own dimension. So the copy is
 * readable both ways: as a chunk when there is no real one, and as one block entity at one position
 * when there is. {@link com.neryos.workbay.mixin.LevelChunkMixin} is the second door; OPEN_ISSUES
 * #80 is what happens without it.
 *
 * <p>One at a time. A player has one screen open.
