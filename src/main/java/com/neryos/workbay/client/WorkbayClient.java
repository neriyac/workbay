     * the world: {@code FogRenderer} scales the fog colour by {@code (y - minBuildHeight) * 0.03125}
     * and then squares it. A room's floor <em>is</em> {@code minBuildHeight} — {@code FLOOR_Y} is 0

     * one is at the very bottom of the world and every fogged thing renders black.

     * {@link com.neryos.workbay.content.room.RoomColour#OVERWORLD} room shows is drawn <b>past</b>
     * the fog for the clouds and not for the sky dome, so a blue midday sky came with a handful of
     * <b>black clouds</b> hanging in it. Found by standing in the room and looking up, which is the
     * only place it can be found. The scale is vanilla's and reads the overworld's own
     * {@code isFlat}, so there is nothing to configure our way out of.
     *
     * <p>The fog becomes the sky's colour instead, which is what the overworld's fog is at that
     * distance anyway. Whole dimension rather than only an open room: nothing sealed can tell, and
     * a check per frame for which room the camera is in would cost more than the effect is worth.
