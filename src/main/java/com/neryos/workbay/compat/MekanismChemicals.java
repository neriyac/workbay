/**
 * Mekanism's chemicals, read the way its fluids and energy already are. SPEC.md §5.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is the one mod with a name in the source.</b> Every other gauge on Bay View comes
 * from a NeoForge capability that any mod can implement, and this class exists because a chemical
 * has none — Mekanism registers its own, and a machine that holds gas would otherwise show a
 * hosted tank as simply absent. Mekanism is too large a share of what anyone racks for "we cannot
 * see it" to be the answer.
 *
 * <p><b>Compiled against its API only, and guarded twice.</b> `compileOnly`, exactly as the JEI and
 * EMI plugins are, so the mod builds and loads with Mekanism absent; every entry point checks
 * {@link ModList} first, and the capability is looked up by name rather than by importing
 * {@code mekanism.common}. {@code BlockCapability.createSided} returns the same object Mekanism
 * registered when the name and type match, which is how a capability is shared without a hard
 * dependency.
