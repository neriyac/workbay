/**
 * The guide, as data. SPEC.md §6.
 *
 * <p><b>There was nowhere a player could look.</b> Right-clicking a Workbay in a recipe viewer
 * gave them a crafting grid and nothing else — no statement of what the block is for, and no
 * first move to make once it is placed. That is the exact moment somebody asks what to do next,
 * and every mod in this genre answers it on that tab.
 *
 * <p>It lives here rather than in either plugin because both viewers want the same list and
 * neither's API is ours: JEI hands a page to {@code addIngredientInfo}, EMI wraps one in an
 * {@code EmiInfoRecipe}, and both are three lines over this. The same argument as the ghost slots
 * next door — two adapters onto one list, and no interface pretending to unify two foreign APIs.
 *
 * <p><b>No text is written here.</b> Every line is a key, so the pages are translated with
 * everything else and the copy stays in one file (SPEC.md §6: the lang file is the truth).
 *
 * <p><b>And it is on the item itself, behind Shift.</b> A player on a plain server has neither
 * viewer, and the pages were reachable nowhere else. The choices were a book item (a recipe and
 * a screen to teach before it teaches), a page on the Workbay screen (needs a Workbay placed, and
 * the Workbay's own page is the one read <em>before</em> that) or the tooltip -- which every
 * player already has, in the recipe book, the inventory and the creative tab, on the exact thing
 * they are wondering about. The unshifted tooltip stays four lines (SPEC.md §6); Shift is where a
 * paragraph is allowed.
