/**
 * Every sound the mod makes. SPEC.md §7's "answers from across the room", heard rather than read.
 *
 * <p><b>All of them are vanilla recordings.</b> No {@code .ogg}: a custom set is a second art
 * budget and none of these moments needs one. What they need is to exist — a machine that racks
 * in silence reads as a mod that did not finish, whatever the inside is like. Each is the mod's
 * <em>own event</em> ({@link WBSounds}) borrowing a vanilla one, because a borrowed event carries
 * the other block's subtitle: "Vault rejects item" over a Workbay refusing. OPEN_ISSUES #91.
 *
 * <p>Two rules decide every entry below, and both come from playing the moment twenty times rather
 * than once.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>A sound belongs to an edge, never to a state.</b> A link moves something every few
 *       seconds for as long as a base runs, so a sound per move is a metronome nobody can turn off.
 *       The Workbay's own blockstate already collapses that into IDLE/RUNNING/STUCK with four
 *       seconds of hysteresis and is written only on a change — so the state change <em>is</em> the
 *       edge, and {@link #started}, {@link #stopped} and {@link #stuck} hang off it and cost no new
 *       bookkeeping at all.
 *   <li><b>Loud for what a player did, quiet for what the mod noticed.</b> Racking is a hand
 *       movement and takes the machine's own placement sound at full volume; a chain deciding it
 *       has run dry is 0.3, which carries about five blocks and is gone in the room next door.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>A refusal is the player's own business, so {@link #refuse} sends it to that player alone
 * through {@code playNotifySound} rather than to the room.
