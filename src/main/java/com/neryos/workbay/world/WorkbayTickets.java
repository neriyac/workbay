/**
 * Force-loading for the Backshop and for a Workbay's own chunk. SPEC §12.
 *
 * <h2>Why this asks the chunk source directly</h2>
 *
 * <p>NeoForge's {@link TicketController#forceChunk} always asks for <b>radius 2</b>: ticket level
 * 31, which drags eight neighbours to level 32 and sixteen more to 33, so one ticket is a
 * five-by-five square of loaded chunks. That is twenty-five chunks to keep one bay column ticking,
 * and there is no argument for sixteen of them — <b>radius 1</b> is level 32, where block entities
 * still tick and random ticks still happen, and the square is three by three. Nine instead of
 * twenty-five, for the same behaviour a hosted machine needs. Only entities freeze, and the one
 * place that can matter is a mob inside an anchored room nobody is standing in.
 *
 * <p>So the radius is {@code chunkTicketRadius}, a host's knob, and the ticket goes in through
 * {@code ServerChunkCache#addRegionTicket} with {@code forceTicks} on — the flag NeoForge's
 * {@code ticking=true} sets, and the one that keeps {@code tickChunk} running with no player
 * nearby. OPEN_ISSUES #60.
 *
 * <p><b>The controller is still registered, and it is now only a purge.</b> Nothing here writes
 * NeoForge's forced-chunk save data any more, but a world written by an earlier version has some,
 * and {@link #validate} is the callback that throws it away on load. Without the registration
 * those tickets would be reinstated on every load by a mod that no longer knows about them, which
 * is the permanent leak §12 exists to prevent. Our own tickets are not persisted at all: the login
 * hook re-arms everything a network is entitled to ({@link AnchorPresence}), which is the same path
 * a restart already took, because {@link #validate} purged everything anyway.
