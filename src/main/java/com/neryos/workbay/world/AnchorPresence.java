/**
 * SPEC.md §12's last line: <b>a ticket exists only while its owner is online</b>, with a short
 * grace period after logout so a running process can finish.
 *
 * <p>This is the bill a server owner is actually afraid of. Without it a player who installs an
 * Anchor and never logs in again costs that server a permanently ticking chunk for ever — and
 * since OPEN_ISSUES #52 that chunk is in the <em>overworld</em>, not only in a dimension nobody
 * else visits. Chunkloaders conventionally stop at logout; a mod whose whole pitch is that it does
 * not cost more than the floor cannot be the exception.
 *
 * <p><b>One rule for every ticket this mod holds, not one per upgrade.</b> Three places force
 * chunks and each one answers the question differently:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Anchored rooms</b> and <b>the Workbay's own chunk</b> are tickets nobody is paying for
 *       by standing anywhere, so both go through {@link #apply}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Mirroring</b> needs nothing. It holds the Backshop column exactly while the Workbay
 *       block ticks, and the block only ticks while its own chunk is loaded — by the Anchor, which
 *       this releases, or by a player being there, which is the case §12 prices at zero. Gating it
 *       as well would only mean a chain stops working while a player is standing next to it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>What happens to work in progress: it pauses, and loses nothing.</b> Nothing this mod moves
 * is ever in flight between ticks — {@link com.neryos.workbay.bus.BusRunner} takes from the source
 * and gives to the sink inside one tick, the skim it took is banked in the same tick by
 * {@code settleAssay}, and the Workbay's FE buffer is saved. So a released chunk is a chain
 * standing still, not a chain dropping a batch: every hosted machine keeps its own progress the way
 * any unloaded block entity does, and the counts on both ends of every link are the counts that
 * were there at logout.
 *
 * <p>Presence is read off the player list rather than a set kept here, because a set can desync
 * from reality and the list cannot. The grace map is the only state, it only ever holds players who
 * have logged out, and an entry is dropped the moment it is spent.
