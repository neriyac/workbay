 * helping you run it — and the middle one kept suggesting itself until it was built: a factory
 * has people meant to <em>work</em> it and not rebuild it, and with two levels the only way to let
 * somebody take an ingot out of a barrel was to let them break the barrel. The ring is ordered by
 * how much it gives away, so a click steps one rung up and round to the safe end.
 *
 * <p>The owner is not a level. An owner is the network that owns the room, and there is exactly
 * one; putting them on this ring would make "owner" a thing you could be invited to.
