/**
 * Every number that decides how this mod plays, and nothing that has entries. SPEC.md §13.
 *
 * <h2>Where the line is, and why</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two audiences. A <b>datapack</b> is what a modpack ships: versioned with the pack, loaded per
 * world, and the place for anything with <em>entries</em> — what a Workbay costs
 * ({@code data/workbay/recipe/}), and what may
 * be hosted (SPEC.md §11's tags). All three already exist and are already the only place those
 * answers live, so a pack carrying a mod we have never seen fixes a bad interaction there without
 * waiting for us. <b>Config</b> is what one host tunes for one server: switches, caps, and the
 * scalars below.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing new joined the datapack side, on purpose.</b> What was left in Java was
 * <em>scalars</em> — a conversion rate, a throughput ceiling, a chunk radius — and a scalar in a
 * datapack registry buys a pack nothing that a shipped {@code defaultconfigs/} TOML does not
 * already give it, while costing a reload listener, a sync packet, and a second place the same
 * number can be written down and disagree with itself. SPEC.md §0 settled "everything else is a
 * tag or a recipe" against <em>a config section per subsystem</em>, which is why there is one
 * section here and not five: the root holds the caps and the chunk bill, and
 * {@code throughput} holds what a link is worth to run.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately not a knob, and where the answer is instead</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every one of these was asked and answered "no", so the next person does not have to ask again.
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The buffer's size (100,000 FE) and how fast it fills (10,000 FE/t).</b> The capacity is
 *       saved per block and restored off the item a Workbay was broken into, so lowering it mid-world
 *       leaves blocks holding more than they can hold; and at any draw a pack would plausibly set,
 *       100,000 is minutes of running. The two power draws below are the knob that makes the buffer mean
 *       something.</li>
 *   <li><b>What one rate step is worth per resource</b> ({@code MB_PER_RATE} 100,
 *       {@code FE_PER_RATE} 1000). Constants, because changing one <em>rescales every saved
 *       link</em> in every existing world.</li>
 *   <li><b>The speeds a link may run at.</b> Fixed, because each has to divide the 1200-tick
 *       transfer wheel; a free number does not.</li>
 *   <li><b>How many rows one Connector may carry.</b> As many as the player pulls in: each row is
 *       its own channel, and a cap on that is a cap on the product (SPEC.md §0).</li>
 *   <li><b>Room sizes, room biomes, and what may be hosted.</b> Datapack, all three: the Frames are
 *       recipes ({@code data/workbay/recipe/}), biomes are {@code #workbay:room_biomes}, hostability
 *       is §11's tags. A pack drops the Vast Room Frame recipe to cap room size.</li>
 *   <li><b>Rooms as a feature.</b> {@code maxRoomsPerNetwork} stops at 1 rather than 0. A host who
 *       is worried about the <em>chunk</em> cost of rooms sets {@code maxAnchoredRoomsPerNetwork}
 *       to 0, which is the whole bill; a host who wants no private dimensions at all drops the Room
 *       Frame recipe, which is the datapack side of the same line.</li>
 *   <li><b>Bay and room geometry</b> — the 8-block bay pitch, the 8-chunk column spacing, the
 *       512-block room region spacing. Baked into every saved world: changing one moves bays and
 *       rooms that already exist.</li>
 *   <li><b>Whether the mod patches vanilla classes at all.</b> That one <em>is</em> a host's switch
 *       and it cannot live here: {@code config/workbay-mixins.properties} is read before class
 *       transformation, which is earlier than any {@code ModConfigSpec} exists.</li>
 * </ul>
