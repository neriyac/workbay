/**
 * One face of a bay's interior. SPEC.md §2.
 *
 * <p>It is what makes a bay a room rather than a hole: a machine with air neighbours has nothing to
 * push into, never sees redstone, and corrupts if it writes a bounding block. A Port gives the
 * machine something on every side.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately has <b>no block entity</b>. A Port's identity is its position — the bay column
 * layout in {@link com.neryos.workbay.world.BayGeometry} is pure arithmetic, so which Workbay and
 * which bay a Port belongs to is derivable and never needs storing, syncing or migrating.
 *
 * <p>Not craftable, not obtainable and not breakable. A bay with a missing wall is a state nothing
 * can recover from, so there is no way to reach it.

     * Port, take one away, or change geometry SPEC.md §8 has baked into saved worlds, the Port
     * forwards the click to the block behind it — so a right-click in a bay is an ordinary
     * right-click on the machine, and every mod's own screen opens with no per-mod code.

     * remotely from the overworld does not work and is not a matter of tuning: the client resolves
     * the menu's block entity out of the one level it has, finds nothing, and disconnects. Standing
     * here, the client <em>is</em> in the Backshop with the chunk loaded, so the same lookup
     * succeeds. See OPEN_ISSUES "Facts worth not rediscovering".
