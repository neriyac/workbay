 * A link, as a block you can point at. SPEC.md §0 and §9.
 *
 * <p>The player pairs a Connector to a Workbay by right-clicking that Workbay with it, then sticks
 * it on any chest, tank or machine. Placing it is what creates the LINKS row; breaking it is what
 * removes it. That is the AE2 import-bus idiom with the cable removed, and it is what Flux Networks
 * and XNet both do — a link the player cannot see, find or break in the world is a link they cannot
 * debug either.
 *
 * <p><b>The block touches one face; the Workbay drives all six.</b> {@code FACING} points into the
 * target, and the target is simply {@code pos.relative(facing)}; which of the target's faces
 * actually answers is settled by {@link com.neryos.workbay.bus.BusEndpoint}, which tries all of
 * them. Nothing about the target's own orientation matters here.
