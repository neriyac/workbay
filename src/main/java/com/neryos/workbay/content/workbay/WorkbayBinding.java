/**
 * What a Workbay item remembers about the Workbay it came from. SPEC.md §2 and §14.
 *
 * <p>Breaking a Workbay leaves its bays and its machines behind in the Backshop; this is the thread
 * back to them, so re-placing the item rebinds to the same bays rather than minting an empty one.
 * That is also why the counts are here: a tooltip renders on the client, which has no registry to
 * ask, and SPEC.md §6 wants the item to say what it is holding before you place it.
 *
 * <p>The stream codec goes through the codec rather than {@code StreamCodec.composite}, which caps
 * at six components and this exceeds.
