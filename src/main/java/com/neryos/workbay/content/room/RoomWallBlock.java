/**
 * A room's shell, and its way out. SPEC.md §8.
 *
 * <p><b>Not bedrock.</b> Bedrock was the placeholder that said "you cannot break this" and nothing
 * else; six faces of it around a room somebody lives in is a quarry, not a room. This says the
 * same thing, carries a colour while it says it, and is the door.
 *
 * <p><b>The doors are the way out, and only the doors.</b> Three shapes were tried. A single Exit
 * block on the entry pad was wrong twice over — it could be lost, and in a 46-block room it had to
 * be walked back to. Then <em>every</em> block of the shell opened the screen, which fixed both and
 * bought a new fault: a room is a place you build in, and a wall that opens a menu every time you
 * right-click near it is a wall you cannot work against. So the {@code DOOR_*} parts, and nothing
 * else. Four doors, one dead centre on each of the four walls, none of them more than half a room
 * away and none of them breakable: the reason the Exit block was replaced is answered by there
 * being four, not by there being ten thousand. Neriya's call, made standing in one.
 *
 * <p><b>It refuses to be destroyed.</b> -1 hardness stops a pick and not a creative click, and a
 * hole in a room's shell is a hole into the void with a player beside it.
