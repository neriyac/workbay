 * A room, as the block a bay hosts. SPEC.md §0 and §8.

 * <p>The block is the room's <em>presence</em> in a bay and nothing more: it has no block entity,
 * no capabilities and no faces, so a bay holding one has no channels of its own -- the room's
 * machines are reached through Connectors placed inside it. Which room it is lives on the bay's
 * record ({@code WorkbayRecord.Bay#room}), never on the block; the block is racked and ejected by
 * {@link com.neryos.workbay.world.BayHosting} like any machine and {@link RoomItem} is what carries
 * the room between bays. It cannot be placed anywhere else: {@link RoomItem#useOn} refuses.
 *
 * <p>Three sizes are three blocks of one class, so the bay's {@code hosted} id says the size.
