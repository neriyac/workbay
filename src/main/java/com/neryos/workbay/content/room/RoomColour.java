/**
 * What a room's shell is painted. SPEC.md §8.
 *
 * <p><b>Ours, not {@code DyeColor}'s sixteen.</b> Half of that enum is signage — lime, magenta,
 * orange — drawn to be seen across a field, and a room is a place somebody spends an evening
 * inside. These are muted on purpose, and the default is the grey-blue that reads closest to the
 * bedrock it replaced.
 *
 * <p>They are <b>tints, not textures</b>: one greyscale wall is multiplied by the value below, so a
 * new colour is one line here and never a new PNG. None of them is dark, because a multiply against
 * a mid-grey wall darkens it once already.
 *
 * <p><b>The floor gets its own tint</b>, and for every colour but one it is the same value. That
 * one is {@link #OVERWORLD}, where the point is that walls and floor disagree.
