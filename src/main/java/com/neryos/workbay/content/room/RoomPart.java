 * <p>The {@code DOOR_*} parts are two doors: a <b>1×2</b> one ({@code DOOR_BOTTOM}, {@code
 * DOOR_TOP}) for a wall with an odd number of blocks, which has a middle block, and the quarters
 * of a <b>2×2</b> one for a wall with an even number, which has a middle seam. Either way the door
 * is dead centre, which is what Neriya asked for on 2026-09-14: every shipped size is odd, so
 * the 2×2 sat half a block off and the eye caught it.
