/**
 * Lets a screen find the machine it was opened for. Client only.
 *
 * <p><b>The chunk, not the block entity.</b> Patching {@code Level#getBlockEntity} was measured and
 * was not enough: Mekanism — and every mod using the same near-universal helper — asks whether the
 * chunk is loaded <em>first</em>, and gives up before any lookup happens. The disconnect it throws
 * says so in as many words: "Client could not locate tile at BlockPos(x=8, y=10, z=8) for tile
 * container." A hosted machine's chunk is in a dimension that client was never sent, so the answer
 * is no, whatever the block-entity call would have returned.
 *
 * <p>So the chunk is what is answered. One synthetic {@link LevelChunk} holding one block state and
 * one block entity, and every guard downstream — {@code hasChunkAt}, {@code getChunkAt},
 * {@code getBlockState}, {@code getBlockEntity} — is satisfied by the ordinary path instead of
 * being patched one at a time.
 *
 * <p>A real chunk always wins: only vanilla's {@code null} and its shared empty chunk are replaced.
 * It has to — a chunk vanilla hands over is the world the player is standing in, and swapping it for
 * a chunk of air would put a hole in their terrain.
 *
 * <p><b>That collision is not rare, and it is not handled here.</b> A network's bay column is
 * allocated from index zero, so the first network anybody makes is in chunk (0, 0), which any player
 * building near the world origin has loaded. Then this returns their overworld and the copy is never
 * consulted. {@link LevelChunkMixin} answers that case <em>per position</em>, which is the one thing
 * a chunk-level hook cannot do. OPEN_ISSUES #80.
