/**
 * The question mods ask before {@link LevelMixin}'s: is that chunk even loaded?
 *
 * <p>Mekanism's {@code WorldUtils.isBlockLoaded} gates every tile lookup on it, so without this the
 * block-entity answer is never reached. Also a fact about a block and not about the player.
 *
 * <p>True only for the one chunk holding a machine whose own screen is open, and only while it is
 * open. The honest cost: for that chunk, in the player's own dimension, "loaded" is answered yes
 * when the ordinary answer would be no — so code that asks and then fetches gets whatever is really
 * there, which is air.
