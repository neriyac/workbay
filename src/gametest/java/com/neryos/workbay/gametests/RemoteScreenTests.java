/**
 * A hosted machine's screen, opened without going anywhere. SPEC.md §5.
 *
 * <p>Only half of that is testable here, and it is the half worth guarding: a gametest has no
 * client, so it can prove the server opened a screen and kept it open, never that the client drew
 * one. The client half — a menu resolving a block entity in a dimension it was never sent — is
 * {@code LevelMixin}, and only a real client can say whether it holds.
 *
 * <p>A <b>vanilla furnace</b> on purpose. Its {@code stillValid} is the standard one every mod
 * inherits when it does not write its own, and it lands exactly on {@code canInteractWithBlock} —
 * so this measures the injection rather than one mod's opinion of it.
