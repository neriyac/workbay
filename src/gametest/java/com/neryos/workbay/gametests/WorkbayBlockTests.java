    /**
     * Reported from play: mining a Workbay with a diamond pickaxe took a long time and then it
     * just vanished, no item. {@link #bindingSurvivesBreakAndPlace} did not catch this because it
     * breaks the block through {@code Block.getDrops} directly, which is the loot table's own
     * query path and skips the step that actually failed.
     *
     * <p>The real path is {@code ServerPlayerGameMode#destroyBlock}, and it only calls
     * {@code Block#playerDestroy} — which is what queries the loot table — when
     * {@code player.hasCorrectToolForDrops(state)} is true. That in turn is
     * {@code !state.requiresCorrectToolForDrops() || tool.isCorrectToolForDrops(state)}, checked
     * against the block's own {@code minecraft:mineable/*} tag membership. Both Workbay and
     * Connector copy their properties from {@code Blocks.IRON_BLOCK}, which sets
     * {@code requiresCorrectToolForDrops()} — but copying properties does not copy tag
     * membership, and neither block was ever added to {@code minecraft:mineable/pickaxe}. So no
     * tool was ever "correct", the correct-tool branch never ran, and the block was simply removed
     * with nothing dropped — silently, because {@code destroyBlock} returns {@code true} either
     * way and nothing here throws.
